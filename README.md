# SimulatedAnnealing
Problems solved with simulated Annealing

Free Hanging Necklace problem:
-"A necklace features 20 equal beads on a very light string that is suspended from both ends. Every bead can sag to any of the 20 discrete levels and thus decrease its potential energyby one unit per level. However, by doing that, it increases the springenergy to the neighboring beads that is proportional to the square ofthe level difference."
-Determined Equilibrium of energy v temp
-fit necklace equilibrium curve with catenary curve

Solved (a version of) the traveling salesman problem with simmulated annealing and brute force (to compare)
